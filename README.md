# Monte-Carlo-Simulations

This project contians different python modules that perform a Monte-Carlo-Simulations for certain problem.

game_monteCarlo.py is a Monte Carlo simulation for a very basic Roulett game. It analysis different game strategies and shows the differences between the strategies on winning and life expectancy of the player.

Queue_simulation.py is a Monte Carlo simulation for Finite State machince , an infinite queue in this case with items randomly arrive and randomly leave with a rate that is a negative exponential distriubtion random variable . The simulation tracks the effect of different rates on the state(number of items) of the queue.
